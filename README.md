## Golang + HTMX Learning Project (YQWeb)

This project serves as a learning experience for myself in the exciting world of Golang and HTMX. I picked up templating and Tailwind CSS along the way to create a quick prototype.

As a DevOps Engineer, I've recently explored the power of `yq` by Mike Farah (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases) for crafting shell scripts. My intention with this project is to:

- Build YAML filters that mirror the functionality of popular JSON filter websites.
- Deepen my understanding of Golang by applying it to practical use cases.
